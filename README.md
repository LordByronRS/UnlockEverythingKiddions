# UnlockEverythingKiddions

Original script by gir489returns can be found here: [UnlockEverything](https://github.com/YimMenu-Lua/UnlockEverything)

The "helper script" was originally made by fangshun2004 and can be found here: [KiddionScript](https://github.com/fangshun2004/kiddon-script)

I updated the helper script and tried my best to convert everything to Kiddions Lua. A few unlocks won't work, because they are using tunables or native calls.
